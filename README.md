# Ataxia_project

CoOrdiPlay is a Flutter-based healthcare application designed to help individuals with ataxia improve motor coordination, balance, and fine motor skills through interactive, gamified therapy.
The app uses motion sensors, real-time tracking, and haptic (vibration) feedback to make rehabilitation engaging, accessible, and effective outside traditional clinical settings.
